You can restrict the Route Graph to be accesible only to a particular (set of) App User Role(s), or keep it "Open for all" or "Closed for all".

Furthermore, you can set a Delay on a particular part of the network or mark sections of the route as one-way only. Delays are used to discourage the creation of Routes through a particular part of the network where it might be inconvenient to be.

TODO - check if okay: When getting Directions, you do not have to take anything particular into account as the generated Route will already include any restrictions there might on the Graph.
