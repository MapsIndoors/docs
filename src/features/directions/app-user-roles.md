With MapsIndoors, it is possible to set restrictions on parts of your Venue for specific App User Roles.

An example could be a part of a hospital that is closed off for visitors, but accessible to medical staff, or a concert venue only guests with a particular ticket can access.

App User Roles are defined in the CMS, and each Route Element on the Route Graph can have an App User Role assigned.
