Using your app built on MapsIndoors, your users can get Directions from their current position to any place within your MapsIndoors Solution, using any transportation method they preferâ€”be it car, bike or public transportation, besides just walking.

Directions using the MapsIndoors Route Graph is restricted to only Walking, but the network is made to connect seamlessly to Google Maps' network and handle transitions between the two fluently.
