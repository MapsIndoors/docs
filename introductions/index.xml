      <description>To get an introduction to the field of indoor positioning, we recommend this blog post for a start.
MapsIndoors SDK is not an IPS (Indoor Positioning Service). MapsIndoors provides indoor maps and indoor directions, and since it is based on Google Maps, we also provide seamless indoor/outdoor integration.
With this in mind you need to find an IPS and then use the location from that IPS in MapsIndoors. To some extend iOS CoreLocation and Android Location Services can fulfill the role of an IPS, depending on the building infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Note! This document describes a pre-release feature. We reserve the right to change this feature and the corresponding interfaces without further notice. Any mentioned SDK versions are not intended for production use.
 At MapsPeople we are in the process of shaping up a new feature in MapsIndoors SDK for Android and iOS called Location Data Sources. Basically we are making it possible to register your own custom data source, adhering to a very simple interface.</description>
