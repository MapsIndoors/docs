### Changed
- Updated Google Maps SDK from 3.1.0 to 3.3.0 (see https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/releases for details)

### Added
- Support for building default floors.

- Support for travelmode specific venue entrypoints, so f.ex. driving routes can go via parking lots (require data configuration).
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue with loading solution-data from the MapsIndoors backend.

- Fixed a rare race condition during initialization.

- Fixed info window not appearing for selectedLocation after several api key switches.

## [3.1.1] 2019-06-21
### Fixed
- Fixed `MPMapControl.go(to:MPLocation)` so that the map now properly fits locations with polygons.
- Fixed dataset switching sometimes not working due to re-initialisation not properly executed behind the scenes.
- Fixed memory issues related to entering and leaving a MapsIndoors map multiple times in the same session.
