# Get your Google Maps API keys

You need to setup the Google Maps API in your project by following the steps in the link below:

* iOS: [Google Maps SDK for iOS](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/start).

Some Web Service APIs are needed also for the MapsIndoors SDK, so make sure to enable them when getting your key:

* [Google Maps Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start).
* [Google Maps Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/start).
* [Google Places API Web Service](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/intro)
