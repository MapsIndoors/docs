## Set the MapsIndoors Content and API keys

In order to include MapsIndoors in your app, you need a content key. If you are not a customer you can use this content key `57e4e4992e74800ef8b69718` to follow this guide.

In order to include MapsIndoors in your own app with your own content, you need to [contact MapsPeople](https://resources.mapspeople.com/contact-us) to get your building drawings processed and hosted by us.

You will receive a unique content API key to use when access has been granted. If you are exploring how this service can become part of your own product, you can read about [partnering with MapsPeople here](https://www.mapspeople.com/become-a-partner).
