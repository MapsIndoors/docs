## Basic Examples

For simple examples of MapsIndoors implementations, run `pod try MapsIndoors` (see below for setting up CocoaPods or just clone [this repository](https://github.com/MapsIndoors/MapsIndoorsIOS/tree/SDK_V3)) and run the XCode Scheme called *Demos*. The code for these samples are to find in the */Example/DemoSamples* folder.

You can also follow the tutorials on this site to start your app from scratch or to enhance the basic examples.
