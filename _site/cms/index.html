<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The MapsIndoors Content Management System (CMS) allows you to maintain your data within the MapsIndoors platform.</p>
<p>Data is structured in a hierarchy where the top level is your Solution which can contain multiple Venues, which in turn can have multiple Buildings and so on. The data-types in hierarchical order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solution</li>
<li>Venues</li>
<li>Buildings</li>
<li>Floors</li>
<li>Locations (rooms and points of interest)</li>
</ul>
<p>View the tutorial video below for more information about terminology and hierarchy.</p>

<p>Although a point of interest can be placed within a room, it is not required. Points of interest can also be placed &quot;outside” on the ground level which is also the layer where the Google map exists. In this case the POI belongs to the Venue directly.</p>
<h2>Navigating the CMS</h2>
<p>The panel on the left lets you navigate the CMS.</p>
<p>There are 2 different roles in the system:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Editor</strong> - Editors can create new Locations, make changes to and remove existing Locations</li>
<li><strong>Admin</strong> - Administrators have editor rights and have access to icon settings and users</li>
</ul>
<p>View the tutorial video below for more information about the menu structure and user roles.</p>

<h3>Image with IndoorView</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>IndoorView is only supported for web
{: .mi-careful}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get started using the IndoorView feature for your Locations, please make sure that the <em>Google Street View panorama images</em> are publicly available for your building by looking at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a>. If no imagery is available, please <a href="https://www.google.com/streetview/contacts-tools/">contact a certified Street View Photographer</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click &quot;Set Street View image”</p>
<ul>
<li>This will open a Google Street View window showing the image closest to this Location. Please note that the MapsIndoors CMS looks for panorama images within a certain radius from the Location's position, so make sure to have panorama images published in that area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Navigate Street View and find an image and viewing angle that is suitable</p>
</li>

<p>IndoorView only supports <strong>publicly</strong> available Google Street View imagery. If you would like to know more about <strong>privately</strong> hosted panorama images, please see <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/streetview#CustomStreetView">Googles Custom Street View documentation</a>.</p>
<h5>Developing your own app</h5>
<p>When developing your own app, you can still use the MapsIndoors CMS to save the Google Street View image information to a Location. When the Panorama image is set, the Location gets populated with a <code>streetViewConfig</code> property. Please see below for an example.</p>
<p>Location Object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">{
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;586ce41ebc1f571794b9e924&quot;,
   ...
  &quot;properties&quot;: {
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Copenhagen&quot;,
     ...
    &quot;streetViewConfig&quot;: {
      &quot;panoramaId&quot;: &quot;CAoSLEFGMVFpcE41dTZnVzNpVnU1WmliRjk0T2tpMENhZ3Fya3ljVFh3TjVzN2lY&quot;,
      &quot;povHeading&quot;: 203.1294893976259,
      &quot;povPitch&quot;: -13.068754012666432
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The parameters above can be used to show a static Street View image through the Street View Static API. Please see <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/streetview/intro">the Street View documentation</a> for more information.</p>
<p>A Street View panorama image can be initialized in a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> the following way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">function initStreetView(streetViewConfig) {
       const panorama = new google.maps.StreetViewPanorama(
            document.getElementById('panorama'),
            {
                pano: streetViewConfig.panoramaId,
                pov: {
                    heading: streetViewConfig.povHeading,
                    pitch: streetViewConfig.povPitch
                },
                zoom: 0,
                visible: true
            });
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Location Types</h2>
<p><img src="https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/cms/assets/images/guide6.png" alt="Location Types"></p>
<p>This is a list of all the Location Types in the Solution. From this list you can edit each Location by clicking on the pencil.</p>
<h3>View Settings</h3>
<p>The <em>View settings</em> can be set for each Location Type. Use the settings to define how and when the icon and/or label is displayed on the map, and what is shown in the label.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.markdownguide.org/assets/cms/location-types/view-settings.png" alt="View Settings"></p>
<h4>Location Type templates</h4>
<p>You can add custom data fields to Locations by adding templates to a Location Type defining the data fields. All Locations of a Type will inherit the templates defined for the Type. Add a template to a Location Type by clicking the template button to the right in the table.</p>
<p>To display or otherwise use the custom data, your app needs to be customized. The properties are not available in the Standard app, only when building one using the SDK.</p>
<p>View the tutorial video below for more information about location types.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PyQOMnJP0Z8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p><strong>New user:</strong> Click on new user bottom at top. Enter email, choose Editor or Administrator, and assign the appropriate Solution. Click Create.</p>
<h2>Logs</h2>
<p>The Audit Log functionality is a configurable feature in MapsIndoors and if not enabled on your Solution it can be on request.</p>
<p>The Audit Log feature can be used to access the Audit log on MapsIndoor data objects, i.e. you can find or inspect the change history.</p>
<p>The Log functionality is found in the Log menu point in the left menu of the MapsIndoors CMS.</p>
<p><img src="https://app.mapsindoors.com/mapsindoors/cms/assets/images/guide9.png" alt="Audit log"></p>
<p>The Log can be filtered on date, ID, User and Data object types. When pressing download a comma separated file (csv) will be stored on your computer's hard drive.</p>
<p>The log will be in CSV format, which can be opened by a spreadsheet program eg. Excel. Each log entry represents a modification in the data. In short, each entry tells at what time who did what to which object.</p>
<p>The headers represented are:
Time, User, Action, ObjectType, ObjectId and ObjectData</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time:</strong> Tells which user did the change (The email representing the user logged in to the system)</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Tells what happened:
<ul>
<li>If data was added, the 'Action' will be set to 'Created'</li>
<li>If data was changed, the 'Action' will be set to 'Changed'</li>
<li>If data was deleted, the 'Action' will be set to 'Deleted'</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>ObjectType:</strong> Tells what type of data was modified (eg. ‘building’, ‘location’, ‘user’, ‘graphdata’ ... )</li>
<li><strong>ObjectId:</strong> Is a unique ID that represents the given data - Building, Location or whatever it is.
If you want to see a history of that specific Location this ID can be used to filter by</li>
<li><strong>ObjectData:</strong> Is a JSON formatted representation of the actual data stored in the MapsIndoors system. To see what changed you can compare this data to the previous change.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of use cases could be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>How to do I get Network history?</strong> Filter the ObjectType to ‘graphdata’ to see these entries. To find a particular user history, filter ‘User’ to their email as well.</li>
<li><strong>How to do I get Categories history?</strong> Filter the ObjectType to ‘category’ to see these entries. To find a particular data history, filter ‘User’ to their email as well.</li>
<li><strong>How to do I get Location Type/type template/visibility history?</strong> Filter the ObjectType to ‘locationtype’ to see these entries. To find a particular data history, filter ‘User’ to their email as well. The type template is covered in the &quot;LocationTypeField” section of the data. The visibility is covered in the &quot;displayrule” section of the data</li>
<li><strong>How to find user login activity?</strong> When a user logs in, the corresponding user object will be changed too (the ‘last login field will be updated’). Filter the ObjectType to ‘user’ to see login entries. To find a particular user login history, filter ‘User’ to their email as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use Excel you can find a video on how to open a CSV file here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5Pxil4jVO4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5Pxil4jVO4</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Icons:</strong> Icons are used for various Locations on the map, e.g. POIs, Rooms. Having a unified representation for specific types of Locations makes the system easier for users to engage with.</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong>: A term used for all Rooms and points of interest (POI).</li>
<li><strong>POI</strong>: &quot;Point of interest” - is usually an object that isn’t tied to a room. E.g. Vending Machine, Locker, A Statue, ATM etc.</li>
<li><strong>Type</strong>: All Locations are of a type. Types serve as templates for Locations to provide a basic setup. Many of the properties can later be overridden for specific Locations.</li>
<li><strong>Venue</strong>: Typically a collection of Buildings that are close geographically.</li>
<li><strong>Search alias</strong>: An alternative name for a Location allowing users to search for the Location by that name.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Managing icons</h2>
<p>Anywhere in the CMS you can change icons for one or more markers on the map, you use the Icon Manager to do so. Click the &quot;Change&quot;-button to invoke it.</p>
<p>In the Icon Manager, you can choose between a predefined set of MapsIndoors icons, and a list of your uploaded icons. We support uploads of image files in the PNG and SVG formats. Click on an icon in either place, and set it to close the icon manager and preview the icon on the map. Don't worry, it won't be saved until you click &quot;Save&quot; in the details editor.</p>
<p>Remember to keep your icons at a reasonable size. We'll let you know if it's larger than 128x64px, as that would take up a large amount of space on the map. There is a hard limit on the image size of 900x600px or 150kb. The images should also be optimized and compressed to be as small as possible.</p>
<p>You can bulk upload SVGs and PNGs at the same time.</p>
<p>To delete an icon, click the &quot;trash bin&quot; on the image files you want to delete. It is strongly advised to change icons on the Locations, Location Types or Categories before deleting their associated icon file. However, if you delete an icon that is already used by a Location, the Location will revert back to using the icon for its Location Type. If you delete an icon that is used by a Category or Location Type, it will revert to using a generic marker on the map.</p>
<h3>Uploading PNGs</h3>
<p>When uploading a PNG image file, make sure you upload it in a 3x size to accommodate for it being scaled down on the map. For example, to display a 20x20px icon on the map, upload it in 60x60px.</p>
<h3>Uploading SVGs</h3>
<p>SVG is a vector file format, which lets MapsIndoors convert your icon in a range of sizes to get the best looking icon in every situation.</p>
<p>SVGs should be uploaded with a <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> that you want the SVG to be displayed on the map in. Make sure you define it in <code>px</code>, not <code>cm</code> or <code>%</code>. E.g., if you want to display a 32x24px icon on the map, upload an SVG with the attributes <code>width='32px'</code> and <code>height='24px'</code>. For consistency, it's good form to make the <code>viewport</code> the same size as the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code>.</p>
<h3>Supported SVG elements</h3>
<p>We only accept SVGs that conform to a very strict ruleset. If an uploaded SVG contains anything other than the elements and attributes listed below, it's rejected. All child elements can be nested as supported by the SVG format.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element</li>
<li><code>viewbox</code> attribute</li>
<li><code>&lt;path&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;rect&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;title&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;desc&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;circle&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;defs&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;ellipse&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;line&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;pattern&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;polygon&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;polyline&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;text&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;stop&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;use&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;linearGradient&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;radialGradient&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;symbol&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;style&gt;</code> child element</li>
<li><code>&lt;tspan&gt;</code> child element</li>
</ul>
<p>When you try to upload an SVG containing one or more of these elements and/or attributes, the upload is cancelled and you will see which files contain the unsupported elements.</p>
<p>If your SVGs contain unsupported elements, you must remove them before they can be uploaded. One typical issue is embedded <code>base64</code> data in the SVG, which usually indicates the SVG will display raster image data (PNGs and the like) somewhere in it. That can lead to unintended consequences on the map.</p>
