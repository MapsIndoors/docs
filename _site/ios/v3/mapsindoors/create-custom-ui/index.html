<p>You can create your own UI based on the MapsIndoors data models given from <code>MPDirectionsService</code> or <code>MPLocationsProvider</code>. E.g. build a list of instructions based on the <code>MPRouteLeg</code> and <code>MPRouteStep</code> models given from a <code>MPRoute</code> object. Or build a content page based on the properties on an <code>MPLocation</code> object. You can see an example of this in the <code>DetailsViewController</code> and <code>DirectionsController</code> classes in the app code that is <a href="https://github.com/MapsIndoors/MapsIndoorsIOS/tree/master/Example">distributed along with the MapsIndoors SDK</a>.</p>
