<li>If you are compiling with Xcode 11 with bitcode ON, you should either switch OFF bitcode or update to version 3.6.0 or later. With bitcode ON, previous versions of the SDK could crash. We are in dialog with Apple regarding the bitcode issue.</li>
<li><a href="https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/123003">This issue</a> makes our SDK crash if built with XCode 10 and below. We implement a workaround in 3.7.0. An immediate workaround for you is to build with XCode 11.
